Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

My task is to recreate the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" using only JavaScript.
I hope to effectively demonstrate my fundamental knowledge of JScript and programming concepts.
The project will begin as a text-based game that is played in a browser console. 

Future versions will see the implementation of a front-end GUI as I learn more about the language.

Current Version: 1.0


Version History:

Version 1.0: 
    Version is a fully functional console game. It will greet the player and prompt them to enter a number that equates to either rock, paper, or scissors. 
    Game will then play a round and display the result to the console.
    Next, the game will loop the above sequence 4 more times. 
    After the 5th round the game will display the overall game winner, as well as the game stats, and an end game message that changes depending on the outcome.
