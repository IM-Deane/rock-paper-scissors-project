Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

My task is to recreate the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" using only JavaScript.
I hope to effectively demonstrate my fundamental knowledge of JavaScript and programming concepts.

UPDATE: Implemented a new version of the project that features a fully functional browser game. The UI consists of a window that displays the game text and a few buttons to input user commands. The goal of this version was to move the game from the console to its own window. 

Future updates will be limited to small tweaks to the UI and fixes to any bugs that arise.


Current Version: 2.3

Version History:

Version 2.3:
    Version is a fully functional browser game that features an interactive GUI. The interface includes a game window, 4 buttons, and a title heading. The game window acts as an output screen that will display various aspects of the game to the player. These features include the roll of each player; current round number and winner; a message that states which roll won (ex. paper beats rock), and some other text that will show depending on certain conditions. 
    The first three buttons of the row are the game's input features. They collect a player's choice and use it to play a round of the game. The last button will reset the game back to default by reloading the webpage.
    To win the game, either the player or computer will need to score 5-points. Each press of the three game buttons will start a new round. Once the win condition is reached, the game displays a final message in an alert box and then refresh the window.

Version 1.0: 
    Version is a fully functional console game. It will greet the player and prompt them to enter a number that equates to either rock, paper, or scissors. 
    Game will then play a round and display the result to the console.
    Next, the game will loop the above sequence 4 more times. 
    After the 5th round the game will display the overall game winner, as well as the game stats, and an end game message that changes depending on the outcome.
