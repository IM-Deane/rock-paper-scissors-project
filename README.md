Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

My task is to recreate the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" using only JavaScript.
I hope to effectively demonstrate my fundamental knowledge of JScript and programming concepts.
The project will begin as a text-based game that is played in a browser console. 

Future versions will see the implementation of a front-end GUI as I learn more about the language.
